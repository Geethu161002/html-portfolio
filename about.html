       <h2> Geethanjali S – Aspiring Full Stack Developer</h2><br>
        <hr>
<p>
I am Geethanjali S, currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at SA Engineering College. With a deep interest in software development and a strong academic foundation in computer science, I am steadily building my expertise in full-stack development. I am passionate about creating meaningful digital solutions, learning new technologies, and contributing to innovative software projects.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been exposed to a wide array of subjects that have equipped me with a well-rounded understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. Courses such as data structures, software engineering, web technologies, and databases have laid a strong foundation, which I continue to build upon through practical coding assignments and self-driven learning.

I have taken a particular interest in full-stack web development, mastering front-end tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, along with back-end technologies including Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I have also gained experience working with version control systems like Git, and I am becoming increasingly comfortable working in collaborative environments that follow Agile practices. My ability to adapt and quickly pick up new frameworks allows me to take on diverse technical challenges confidently.

One of my key learning experiences has been working on a hall booking system project—a web application that enables users to reserve college halls efficiently. This project, which I developed in collaboration with peers and guidance from mentors, taught me how to integrate front-end and back-end components into a cohesive system. It also helped me understand real-world problem-solving and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code.

Beyond technical skills, I possess strong communication, time management, and problem-solving abilities. I have participated in college-level hackathons, where I enjoyed the fast-paced, team-oriented atmosphere that encouraged creativity and rapid prototyping. These experiences have not only sharpened my coding skills but also enhanced my ability to work under pressure and contribute effectively as part of a team.

I am currently exploring cloud platforms, containerization using Docker, and the basics of deploying applications using Kubernetes. This hands-on exposure is helping me understand the modern DevOps culture, which I aim to incorporate into my future development projects.

As I continue my MCA, my short-term goal is to gain internship opportunities where I can apply and expand my full-stack development skills in a professional setting. In the long run, I aspire to work as a software developer in a company that values innovation, continuous learning, and impactful technology.

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring tech communities online, reading about industry trends, and enhancing my skills through platforms like Udemy. I believe in learning by doing and continuously strive to improve myself both as a developer and a problem-solver.

In everything I do, I aim to grow as a responsible, curious, and innovative tech professional who contributes positively to the digital world.
